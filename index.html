      <h2>The path to the final</h2>
      <p>
        It took LIverpool all that they had to make it to the final that year.<br>
        I believe they had to play Chelsea in the semi-final.
      </p>

      <h2>The game - first half</h2>
      <p>
        They had us in the first half; not gonna lie.<br>
        3-0 down against Milan is a guarranted loss.
      </p>

      <h2>The game - second half</h2>
      <p>
        Second half and it cannot get any better than this. <br>
        Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard scored a header and the stadium exploded.
      </p>

      <h2>The game - penalty shootout</h2>
      <p>
        When it comes to penalty shootout, the 'weaker' team almost always wins.<br>
        Dudek, the Liverpool goalie, had a night to remember and handed Liverpool the title.
